## Welcome 🪐

I'm a developer providing freelance services; learning new skills, making new and useful projects while I search for a work opportunity that's right for me. 
I *love* working on developments as a team & want to contribute more in collaborative projects.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🔭 Currently working on a new wave mood tracking app to be ready for deployment & user testing + websites for local buisnesses

- 👯 Looking to collaborate on self development or social impact projects that may include personality testing or some sort of resource for neurodivergence & people managing their mental health, especially mood disorders.
- 🙋 Help with staying accountable in my study & work flow. TLDR, fellow enterprising/entrepeneurial colleagues would be nice.
- 💬 Ask me about how I can help you, my story, the businesses I've built, why we need to pave our own paths, what I think the future could look like.
